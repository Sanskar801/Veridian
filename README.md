# Veridian – Creative Marketing Website (Recreation)

A creative, responsive marketing website where I recreated the look-and-feel and core interactions of an existing website. The focus is on high‑impact typography, smooth transitions, and mobile‑first layouts using modern tooling.

## Tech Stack
- Vite + React
- Tailwind CSS
- GSAP (`@gsap/react`) for page transition animations

## Highlights
- Fully responsive layouts (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- Animated “Stairs” page transition using GSAP
- Minimal, bold UI with large type, video hero, and hover reveals
- Reusable components (navbar, full‑screen nav, footer, FAQ, cards)

## Getting Started
```bash
cd client
npm install
npm run dev
```
Then open the URL printed by Vite.

## Available Scripts (client)
- `npm run dev` – start Vite dev server
- `npm run build` – production build
- `npm run preview` – preview production build

## Structure (client/src)
- `components/` – shared UI (layout, home, common)
- `pages/` – views (Home, Work, Contact, etc.)
- `assets/` – images, fonts, media
